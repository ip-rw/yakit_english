# Yakit Translated to English 
## (With Absolutely No Mercy)

**Yak** is an impressively cool concept ([https://github.com/yaklang/yaklang](https://github.com/yaklang/yaklang)). It's a DSL/scripting language tailored for (offensive) security, equipped with a substantial standard library already and a VM and design that makes it usable and _portable_ in ways that things like NSE/MSF struggled to. I could praise Yak all day, but go and look through the code yourself, it's already impressive, yet somehow the thing still feels largely unknown outside of its developers and a few intrigued observers.

**Yakit** is part GUI part ICBM and 100% Chinese. The aim appears to be consolidating all security tools ever created into one, with the majority of functionality implemented in Yak. It's quite remarkable. I used [https://github.com/ip-rw/translate_code/](https://github.com/ip-rw/translate_code/) for the translation. The software compiles and runs without immediatly exploding; anything beyond that is a bonus. This readme likely took longer to create than the translation and few repairs, so overall, it's not too shabby.

Available are an AppImage and an untested exe in the releases here: [https://github.com/ip-rw/yakit_english/releases/tag/en](https://github.com/ip-rw/yakit_english/releases/tag/en)

**The build process roughly involves:**
- `yarn install-render`
- `yarn build-render`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn pack-linux` (or `-win`, or whateverâ€”might work, who knows)

Yak is awesome, guys. Thank you for keeping it free.
